# Python_projects

The repo contains mostly Machine Learning projects for data I found on Kaggle. The biggest challenge was Yfinance project, where I created an app for stock evaluation. It is initialized by Yfinance_preliminary_stock_evaluation file. I used Yahoo finance data for getting the financial ratios. There is a batch import option as well as possibility to check prices and dividends the companies are paying. In Pricing window there is also possibility to forecast stock price using ARIMA model.
